# movie-tracker

# overview

# Instead of building a large public movie catalog, I wanted to make a personalized collection app â€” something that reflects my movie taste and lets me explore my favorite genres in a clean layout. This project helped me practice web development fundamentals like API requests, EJS rendering, and route organization, while also improving my ability to design a focused, aesthetic user experience.
