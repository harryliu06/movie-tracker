# Movie Tracker
I have created this web app to track the movies and series I have watch over the years. 

# Overview
Instead of building a large public movie catalog, I wanted to make a personalized collection app â€” something that reflects my movie taste and lets me explore my favorite genres in a clean layout. This project helped me practice web development fundamentals like API requests, EJS rendering, and route organization, while also learning how to incoporate the postgreSQL database to the web app. 

# Tech Stack
  - Frontend - EJS, HTML5, CSS
  - Backend - Node.js, Express.js, Axios
  - API Source - [The Move Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
  - Database - Supabase/PostgreSQL

# Future Idea for the web app
 - Adding a user-interactive interface so that anyone can search the movies and series
 - Improve the web design and implement animations
